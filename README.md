Oligotyping is a novel computational method to decompose very closely related 
taxa within microbial communities by utilizing very subtle nucleotide variation
among 16S Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon reads. It can reveal previously unknown
ecological patterns and diversity concealed within environmental samples.

With oligotyping, depending on the hyper-variable region, similarity threshold
between different types can be as low as 0.2%, more than a magnitude lower than
de facto 3% similarity threshold that is being used by OTU clustering methods.

Here you can find some information about this codebase and learn more about the
oligotyping (this web site is currently under construction, but it will provide
all necessary information for researchers who wish to try oligotyping on their
own datasets):

Oligotyping was first used in this paper, it might give some extra insight:

Oligotyping pipeline is planned to be a part of Viamics:

If you would like to try oligotyping on your datasets, or if you have questions
to ask, please don't hesitate to contact me via meren / mbl.edu.

Thanks for your interest.
