Everything is pretty confusing at this moment, sorry about that. I am hoping to
make it more lucid in time.

Here you can find some information about this codebase and learn about the
method, oligotyping:

    http://oligotyping.org


I had used oligotyping in this paper, it might give some extra insight:

Oligotyping pipeline will probably become a part of Viamics at some point:

Meanwhile, if you are eager to try it on your datasets please don't hesitate to
send me an e-mail via meren / mbl.edu.

Thanks for your patience.
