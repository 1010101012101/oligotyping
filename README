Everything is pretty confusing at this moment, sorry about that. I am hoping to
make it more usable in time.

I had used oligotyping in this paper:

    http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026732

It had worked pretty well for that research, and I've been using it on various
datasets coming from human gut to sewage samples. I promise that I'll explain
the oligotyping pipeline at some point step by step :) It will also eventually
become a part of Viamics:

Meanwhile, if you are eager to try it on your datasets please don't hesitate to
send me an e-mail via meren / mbl.edu.


Thanks for your patience.
