This directory various scripst that once were used and found useful to solve
something. Some of them are incomplete, and most of them lack appropriate
usage information. I am hoping to solve these issues in time. Here is a brief
description of files in this directory and their purpose:

- create_GG_alignment_template_from_taxon.py: Uses GreenGenes core alignment 
  file and otu_id_to_greengenes.txt to generate a template for a given taxon.

- generate_matching_qual_file.py: it is not there yet, but it takes an alignment
  and 454 qual scores in FASTA format for reads in the alignment and 'aligns'
  qual scores to match with the alignment.

- trim_from_the_beginning.py: trims reads in a FASTA file from the beginning.

- generate_consensus_from_alignment.py: a very crude way to generate a consensus
  from many aligned sequences. it is extremely likely to create chimeras with the
  approach implemented in this script.

- populate_datasets_from_VAMPS_download.py: creates a FASTA file for a chosen
  taxon and populates the datasets from a FASTA file that was obtained through
  VAMPS.

- treat_homopolymer_regions.py: this was a very bad idea, but worked magically
  well (worst ideas are the ones that work despite the fact that they were bad
  ideas from the get go). one should never treat their sequences to ameliorate
  systemmatical errors.

- trim_uninformative_columns_from_alignment.py: takes an alignment and removes
  uninformative gaps. it is usually necesary after aligning your reads against
  full length bacterial templates.  your  alignment becomes a universe of gaps.
  this script cleans them out.
