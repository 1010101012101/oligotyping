This directory various scripst that once were used and found useful to solve
something. Some of them are incomplete, and most of them lack appropriate
usage information. I am hoping to solve these issues in time. Here is a brief
description of files in this directory and their purpose:

- create_GG_alignment_template_from_taxon.py: Uses GreenGenes core alignment 
  file and otu_id_to_greengenes.txt to generate a template for a given taxon.

- fasta_length_distribution.py: vizualizes the read length distribution in a
  fasta file.

- gen_dicts_for_qual_stats.py: takes a fasta file and accompanying qual scores
  file and generates a serialized quality scores dict to be used for other
  scripts

- generate_exclusive_figures.py: generates exclusive figures for a previous run
  when the samples mapping is available.

- generate_matching_qual_file.py: it is not there yet, but it takes an alignment
  and 454 qual scores in FASTA format for reads in the alignment and 'aligns'
  qual scores to match with the alignment.

- generate_matrix_files_from_ENVIRONMENT.py: this script can be used to generate
  counts and percent abundance matrices from an environment file.

- gen_stackbar_with_sets_from_ENVIRONMENT.py: this script is good to test 
  different cosine values to merge oligotypes and re-visualize them as a stackbar
  figure.

- pad_with_gaps.py: when reads are not aligned, and not intended to be aligned
  this script can be used to pad shorter reads at the end with gaps to create
  equal lengths.

- populate_datasets_from_VAMPS_download.py: to expand uniqued fasta files downloaded
  from VAMPS.

- smart_trim_from_the_beginning.py: tell this script what percentage of reads
  you are willing to lose, and it will trim longest possible uniform length when
  untrimmed variable length reads aligned.


- generate_consensus_from_alignment.py: a very crude way to generate a consensus
  from many aligned sequences. it is extremely likely to create chimeras with the
  approach implemented in this script.

- populate_datasets_from_VAMPS_download.py: creates a FASTA file for a chosen
  taxon and populates the datasets from a FASTA file that was obtained through
  VAMPS.

- treat_homopolymer_regions.py: this was a very bad idea, but worked magically
  well (worst ideas are the ones that work despite the fact that they were bad
  ideas from the get go). one should never treat their sequences to ameliorate
  systemmatical errors.

- trim.py: simple script to trim from the beginning and the end of an alignment.

- trim_uninformative_columns_from_alignment.py: takes an alignment and removes
  uninformative gaps. it is usually necesary after aligning your reads against
  full length bacterial templates.  your  alignment becomes a universe of gaps.
  this script cleans them out.

- visualize_qual_scores_along_columns.py: does what the name suggests, and uses
  the serialized dictionary generated by 'gen_dicts_for_qual_stats.py'.
